Open Control is a project which tries to make an alternative to UC Surface, the official app for Presonus StudioLive RM16AI and similar mixers.

The original application uses the UCnet protocol, so I am trying to understand it or at least mimic it to try to connect to my mixer.

The main purpose of this project is enable the mixer to be controlled from this alternative app using MIDI commands, which were not implemented on the MIDI ports of the mixer or AES70 (Open Control Aquitecture).
